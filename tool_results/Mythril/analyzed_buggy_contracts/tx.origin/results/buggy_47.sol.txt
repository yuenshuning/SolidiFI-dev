==== Dependence on tx.origin ====
SWC ID: 115
Severity: Low
Contract: AcunarToken
Function name: sendto_txorigin37(address,uint256,address)
PC address: 7097
Estimated Gas Usage: 394 - 489
Use of tx.origin as a part of authorization control.
The tx.origin environment variable has been found to influence a control flow decision. Note that using tx.origin as a security control might cause a situation where a user inadvertently authorizes a smart contract to perform an action on their behalf. It is recommended to use msg.sender instead.
